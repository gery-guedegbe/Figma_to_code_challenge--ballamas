# Figma to Code Challenge: Week 2ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»

Welcome to my solution for the Figma to Code challenge! This project involved converting a Figma design into a fully coded project, putting my front-end development and design skills to the test.

## Overview

In this challenge, I used **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** to create a modern and functional interface. This project not only helped me improve my coding skills but also allowed me to explore new techniques and tools for web development.

## Features

Here are some of the features and animations implemented in this project:

- **Card Animations on Load:** Cards animate into view as the page loads.
- **Image Hover Scale Effect:** Images scale up slightly when hovered over.
- **Category Filtering:** Cards can be filtered by categories.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React.
